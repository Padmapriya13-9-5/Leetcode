This includes Java solutions for common array and string problems, ideal for coding practice and technical interviews.

1. Contains Duplicate
Checks if any value appears at least twice in the given array using a HashSet for efficient lookup.

2. Single Number
Finds the element that appears only once when all others appear exactly twice. Uses XOR operation to achieve linear time and constant space.

3. Merge Sorted Arrays
Merges two sorted arrays, nums1 and nums2, into one sorted array in-place. The elements of nums2 are copied into nums1 and then sorted.

4. Search Insert Position
Returns the index of a target value in a sorted array, or the position where it would be inserted to maintain the order. Implements array extension and sorting to find the position.

5. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Removes duplicates in-place from a sorted array so that each element appears only once, and returns the count of unique elements.

6. Is Subsequence
Checks if one string is a subsequence of another. Iterates through both strings to verify the relative order of characters is preserved.
